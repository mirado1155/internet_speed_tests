The idea came about because my ISP is garbage, and I wanted to see if there is a discernable pattern
of downtime. 

I started by going to speedtest.net by Ookla to see if they had an API which would allow me to test
my internet speed in a script. They did not. However, they had a nifty CLI! So I downloaded that.

From there, I learned how to write the results of the speed test CLI to a file directly from the
command line.

Then, I used python's subprocess library to execute the speed test command at regular intervals.

However, those intervals were not as regular as I would have liked. I was using time.sleep() functions
which unfortunately weren't precise enough because it had to factor in the time taken up by the actual
speed test!
